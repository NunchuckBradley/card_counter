# Card Counting
A card counting program using Python and Tkinter.
Click on the numbers which will show and it will tally what has been clicked on.



### Includes:
- UNDO and REDO
- Likelyhood of pulling the next card
- Number only checking OR full deck and suit checking


### Bads:
- Button press refreshes and reloads ALL buttons
- Complicated to read
- practices and no comments in code

This was made quickly so wont fix these issues
